                <p>Watch out! Lightning is extremely dangerous. A single bolt of lightning can carry a billion volts of electricity. That’s enough energy to light a 100-watt light bulb—for three months! As impressive as it is, lightning is nothing more than a sudden flow of extremely tiny particles. What are the particles that flow in a lightning bolt? The answer is electrons.</p>

                    <h2>What Are Electrons?</h2>

                    <p><strong>Electrons</strong> are one of three main types of particles that make up atoms. The other two types are protons and neutrons. Unlike protons and neutrons, which consist of smaller, simpler particles, electrons are fundamental particles that do not consist of smaller particles. They are a type of fundamental particles called leptons. All leptons have an electric charge of -1 or 0. For an excellent video about electrons and other fundamental particles in atoms, go to this URL: </p>

                    <h2>Properties of Electrons</h2>

                    <p>Electrons are extremely small. The mass of an electron is only about 1/2000 the mass of a proton or neutron, so electrons contribute virtually nothing to the total mass of an atom. Electrons have an electric charge of -1, which is equal but opposite to the charge of proton, which is +1. All atoms have the same number of electrons as protons, so the positive and negative charges “cancel out,” making atoms electrically neutral.</p>

                    <h2>Where Are Electrons?</h2>

                    <p>Unlike protons and neutrons, which are located inside the nucleus at the center of the atom, electrons are found outside the nucleus. Because opposite electric charges attract each other, negative electrons are attracted to the positive nucleus. This force of attraction keeps electrons constantly moving through the otherwise empty space around the nucleus. The Figure shown below is a common way to represent the structure of an atom. It shows the electron as a particle orbiting the nucleus, similar to the way that planets orbit the sun.</p>

                    <h2>Orbitals</h2>

                    <p>The atomic model above is useful for some purposes, but it’s too simple when it comes to the location of electrons. In reality, it’s impossible to say what path an electron will follow. Instead, it’s only possible to describe the chances of finding an electron in a certain region around the nucleus. The region where an electron is most likely to be is called an orbital. Each orbital can have at most two electrons. Some orbitals, called S orbitals, are shaped like spheres, with the nucleus in the center. An S orbital is pictured in Figure below. Where the dots are denser, the chance of finding an electron is greater. Also pictured in Figure below is a P orbital. P orbitals are shaped like dumbbells, with the nucleus in the pinched part of the dumbbell. You can see animated, three-dimensional models of orbitals at the following URL.</p>
                
                    <p>Q: How many electrons can there be in each type of orbital shown above?</p>
                    <p>A: There can be a maximum of two electrons in any orbital, regardless of its shape.</p>
                    <p>Q: Where is the nucleus in each orbital?</p>
                    <p>A: The nucleus is at the center of each orbital. It is in the middle of the sphere in the S orbital and in the pinched part of the P orbital.</p>
